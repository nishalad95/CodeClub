Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. It's really simple and easy to learn. Throughout this notebook you will initially learn the basics of programming in Python, covering operators, statements, variables and loops. We will then move onto some harder topics and if you reach further we have a question applying programming to the physics of Bloodhound SSC!"
